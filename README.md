Data Mesh Manager Connector for Databricks
===

The connector for databricks is a Spring Boot application that uses the [datamesh-manager-sdk](https://github.com/datamesh-manager/datamesh-manager-sdk) internally, and is available as a ready-to-use Docker image [datameshmanager/datamesh-manager-connector-databricks](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/datameshmanager/datamesh-manager-connector-databricks) to be deployed in your environment.

## Features

- **Asset Synchronization**: Sync tables and schemas of the Unity catalog to the Data Mesh Manager as Assets. 
- **Access Management**: Listen for AccessActivated and AccessDeactivated events in the Data Mesh Manager and grants access on Databricks to the data consumer.

## Usage

Start the connector using Docker. You must pass the API keys as environment variables.

```
docker run \
  -e DATAMESHMANAGER_CLIENT_APIKEY='insert-api-key-here' \
  -e DATAMESHMANAGER_CLIENT_DATABRICKS_WORKSPACE_HOST='https://dbc-xxxxxx.cloud.databricks.com/' \
  -e DATAMESHMANAGER_CLIENT_DATABRICKS_WORKSPACE_CLIENTID='your-client-id' 
  -e DATAMESHMANAGER_CLIENT_DATABRICKS_WORKSPACE_CLIENTSECRET='your-client-secret'
  -e DATAMESHMANAGER_CLIENT_DATABRICKS_ACCOUNT_HOST='https://accounts.cloud.databricks.com' \
  -e DATAMESHMANAGER_CLIENT_DATABRICKS_ACCOUNT_ACCOUNTID='your-account-id' \
  -e DATAMESHMANAGER_CLIENT_DATABRICKS_ACCOUNT_CLIENTID='your-account-client-id' \
  -e DATAMESHMANAGER_CLIENT_DATABRICKS_ACCOUNT_CLIENTSECRET='your-account-client-secret' \

## Access Management Flow

When an Access Request has been approved by the data product owner, and the start date is reached, Data Mesh Manager will publish an `AccessActivatedEvent`. When an end date is defined and reached, Data Mesh Manager will publish an `AccessDeactivatedEvent`. The connector listens for these events and grants access to the data consumer in Databricks.

### Consumer Type: Data Product

Example:

- Provider is a data product with ID `p-200` and selected output port `p-200-op-210`. 
- The output port defines the schema `my_catalog.schema_220` in the server section.
- Consumer is a data product with ID `c-300`.
- Access ID is `a-100`.

Connector Actions on `AccessActivatedEvent`:

- Create a new service principal `dataproduct-c-300`, if it does not exist. (if a custom field `databricksServicePrincipal` is defined in the data product, the value will be used as the service principal name instead of the ID)
- Create a new group `access-a-100` for this access.
- Add the service principal `dataproduct-c-300` to the group `access-a-100`.
- Create a new group `team-t-300`, if it does not exist. (if a custom field `databricksGroupName` is defined in the team, the value will be used as the group name instead of the ID)
- Add all members of the team `t-300` to the group `team-t-300`.
- Add the group `team-t-300` to the group `access-a-101`.
- Grant permissions `USE SCHEMA` and `SELECT` on the schema `my_catalog.schema_220` to group `access-a-100`

Connector Actions on `AccessDeactivatedEvent`:

- Delete the group `access-a-100`


### Consumer Type: Team

Example:

- Provider is a data product with ID `p-200` and selected output port `p-200-op-210`.
- The output port defines the schema `my_catalog.schema_220` in the server section.
- Consumer is a team with ID `t-400`.
- Access ID is `a-101`.

Connector Actions on `AccessActivatedEvent`:

- Create a new group `team-t-400`, if it does not exist. (if a custom field `databricksGroupName` is defined in the team, the value will be used as the group name instead of the ID)
- Add all members of the team `t-400` to the group `team-t-400`.
- Create a new group `access-a-101` for this access.
- Add the group `team-t-400` to the group `access-a-101`.
- Grant permissions `USE SCHEMA` and `SELECT` on the schema `my_catalog.schema_220` to group `access-a-101`

Connector Actions on `AccessDeactivatedEvent`:

- Delete the group `access-a-101`


### Consumer Type: User

Example:

- Provider is a data product with ID `p-200` and selected output port `p-200-op-210`.
- The output port defines the schema `my_catalog.schema_220` in the server section.
- Consumer is an individual user with username `alice@example.com`.
- Access ID is `a-102`.

Connector Actions on `AccessActivatedEvent`:

- Create a new group `access-a-102` for this access.
- Add the user `alice@example.com` to the group `access-a-102` (the connector currently assumes that the username in Data Mesh Manager and Databricks are equal).
- Grant permissions `USE SCHEMA` and `SELECT` on the schema `my_catalog.schema_220` to group `access-a-102`

Connector Actions on `AccessDeactivatedEvent`:

- Delete the group `access-a-102`
